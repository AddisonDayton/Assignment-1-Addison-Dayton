Simple design, everything is broken down into small divs. Theres one big box that everything sites in, then smaller sections that are then broken down into simple parts. Most are just  headers and text, but the about me section is a header, text, and an image. My skills and interests has a header and table, whcih just uses the basic table codeing, some thicker lines, and the table heading for the catogories. I included links to some stuff I have worked on in my hobbies section to show off some of my other content. The  coding for that is includied in the text and opens the tabe in a new page. The bottom of the page just has the boxified design to give an overview of how I planned this out.
In terms of javascript use, it is used for layout purposes, the content of the page is in columns and rows and uses javascript classes to lay them out properly.
CSS is also minimal, mainly just the text family and background color, place the code that changes the color on smaller windows, which is pretty much the same code as from the lectures.
The guide on how to use GitHub wasn't amazing, espcially for someone like me who has no prior coding experience, so I'm not sure if everything is displaying propely. In case it isnt, I have including the ZIP folder in my submisson, and please contact me if there are any questions.
